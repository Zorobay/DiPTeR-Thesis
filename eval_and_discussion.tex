\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discuss that one pitfall is getting into local minima, and what could/can be done to avoid it.
    \item How finding correct paramter values within its defined boundaries could have been done. 
    \item Discuss how one might want to switch over to a rendering method that works more similar to OpenGL, or even better, utilize PyTorch3D (also check how they render!)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Finding the correct minimum}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sometimes its difficult to find the correct minima. We're seeking the global minima, but its easy to get stuck in a local minima...
    \item Difficult with colors, as we have logical restrictions on parameter values, but minima might exist for other values...
    \item Some values are cyclical, like hue in HSV shader. A value of h=1.5 gives the same color as h=0.5...
