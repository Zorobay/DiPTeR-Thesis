\begin{enumerate}
    \item Benchmark how much faster matrix shading is compared to for-loops
    \item Compare between loss functions
    \item Compare between optimizers
    \item Include surface plots of loss vs 2 parameters
    \item Compare forward vs backward timings (for a few shaders + a few compsite shaders in a table)...
    \item Autograd profiling: \url{https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#Profiler}
\end{enumerate}
